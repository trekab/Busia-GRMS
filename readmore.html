	<h1>BUSIA DISTRICT BOREHOLES</h1>

	<p>
		The map above displays distribution of boreholes in Busia district. They are categorised under deep boreholes, shallow wells, and springs. From the data displayed a gap of inconsistency in categorization of the boreholes is seen by the first category. Thus either the data is presented in form of duplication or the survey was not done the right way. But on review of the data the error was in data surveying where the categorization was not considered for that phase.
	</p>
	<p>
		Categorization is needed basing on the depth of the well.Shallow wells have the water table close to the earthâ€™s surface and are categorized to 30ft or less. Above 30ft we have deep boreholes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, the deeper wells also have more volume and pressure due to the increased weight bearing down from above.

		The graph above gives the count of boreholes per subcounty. The data displayed above can help in resource allocation. Forexample comparing the household count with borehole count shows the gap for which subcounty to give more boreholes to close the gap of portable water.

	<h1>BOREHOLE YIELD ANALYSIS</h1>

	<p>
		The current existing boreholes in the district display an average of 3.424 cubic meters. With this data set one can come up with an estimate of expected yield for the boreholes in an area.Boreholes with 0 yield were decommissioned but they help to assess for anew borehole with the reasons as to why they were decommissioned. On that note below is graph of average yield per subcounty.

	<p>
		Areas with no representation on yield show a data gap with a possibility of not having been surveyed or data not submitted to the ministry by the company that drilled these boreholes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Buntene subcounty displays to be a better area for high yield boreholes in Busia district. This analysis can be used to get suitability analysis for installation of a water pump station to supply water to the subcounty. More analysis and decisions can be made based on the data available.
